## Key Quotes

### George Griffin, Board Chair (August 2024)
> "My fear tonight is someone is going to get a piece of this presentation and immediately start to say there's another agenda or we're trying to close a school. We're simply not."

### February 2025 Decision Context
The Board ultimately decided NOT to close any schools, opting instead to:
1. Replace the 3 oldest buildings (Carrboro, Estes Hills, FPG)
2. Preserve neighborhood school model
3. Monitor enrollment trends
