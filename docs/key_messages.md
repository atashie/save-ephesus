# Key Messages: Save Ephesus Elementary

## Headline Statement
**Don't Close Ephesus Elementary** - Our neighborhood school is a community asset, not a budget problem.

## Three Core Messages

### 1. Ephesus is a Walkable Community School
- **99 students** walk to school* (*parent-reported)
- Closing Ephesus means more buses (~$57K-$75K/year), more emissions
- Teachers and staff live in the neighborhood they serve
- Generational ties: teachers who taught parents now teach children

**Sound bite:** "Ephesus isn't just a school building - it's the heart of a walkable community."

### 2. Ephesus Delivers Academic Excellence
- **Among top 4 in academic growth** (4th of 11, growth score 85.8, "Exceeded" status)
- Title I school achieving exceptional results
- 2 of 3 EC Pre-K district staff based at Ephesus
- Strong special education programs

**Sound bite:** "Our students are thriving. Why close a school that's succeeding?"

### 3. Ephesus Aligns with Community Investment
- **713 housing units** near Ephesus (563 built + 150 planned at Longleaf Trace)
- Town of Chapel Hill invested in walkable, affordable communities
- Closing Ephesus undermines these strategic investments
- Available land for future campus expansion

**Sound bite:** "The Town is building families toward Ephesus. The district shouldn't push them away."

## Equity Message
Ephesus is a **Title I school** serving:
- 30-36% free/reduced lunch students (verified)
- 50% minority enrollment (verified)
- Pre-K and HeadStart families
- EC Pre-K critical services

**Sound bite:** "Closing Ephesus would disproportionately harm our most vulnerable families."

## Financial Message
The 2024 bond allocates **$174.7 million** to replace three schools built in 1958-1962. A comprehensive analysis should evaluate ALL schools together.

**Request for the Board:** "We request a comprehensive review of all schools—considering facility condition, walkability, enrollment trends, equity, and housing development—before making closure decisions."

## Call to Action
We respectfully request the Board to:
1. **Remove Ephesus from closure consideration**
2. **Recognize Ephesus as a model** neighborhood school
3. **Align school planning with housing development**
4. **Prioritize equity** by protecting Title I schools

## Counter-Argument Responses

### "Ephesus building is old/needs renovation"
- Ephesus is NOT one of the 3 oldest buildings receiving bond funding
- Age doesn't determine community value
- The building serves its purpose well

### "Enrollment is declining"
- 713 housing units (563 built + 150 planned) may drive future enrollment
- Ephesus is positioned for growth, not decline
- Short-term enrollment dips shouldn't drive permanent closures

### "We need to save money"
- Consider hidden costs: transportation, property values, community disruption
- Short-term savings vs. long-term costs
- Ephesus delivers exceptional value per dollar spent
