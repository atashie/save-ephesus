## Road Pollution Exposure (500m Radius)

### All Schools — TRAP Exposure Index

|------|--------|-----------|--------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Glenwood | 19.29 | 18.99 | 1 |
| 2 | FPG Bilingue | 17.61 | 16.75 | 2 |
| 3 | Scroggs | 4.68 | 4.14 | 4 |
| 4 | Carrboro | 4.42 | 4.42 | 3 |

| 10 | Seawell | 0.79 | 0.47 | 10 |
| 11 | Rashkis | 0.18 | 0.15 | 11 |

Index: P = Σ Wᵢ · e^(−λdᵢ), where W = road-class weight (AADT proxy), λ = 0.003 m⁻¹, d = distance to school.

### Ephesus Summary

- **500m raw rank:** #8 of 11 (lower third — moderate exposure)
- **500m net rank:** #8 of 11
- **1000m raw rank:** #5 of 11 (rises due to NC 15-501 proximity)
- **1000m net rank:** #4 of 11
- Tree canopy cover within 500m: 0.6%

Ephesus is not among the most pollution-exposed schools at the 500m radius. However, closing the school and busing 99 walkers would increase their daily TRAP exposure during transit along arterial roads.
