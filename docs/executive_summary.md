# Executive Summary: Don't Close Ephesus Elementary

## The Bottom Line
Ephesus Elementary is a strategic asset for Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools, not a budget problem. Closing this school would undermine walkability, harm vulnerable families, and contradict the district's stated values.

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **#4** | Academic growth ranking | Among top performers ("Exceeded" status) |
| **98%** | Students follow conduct rules | +29 pts above district (NC TWC Survey) |
| **0** | Violence/weapons/drug incidents | Zero reported (NC TWC Survey) |
| **#1** | Most walkable elementary school | 24.7% within 0.5 mi (99 students) |
| **563** | New housing units nearby | 149 affordable + 414 market-rate |
| **30-36%** | Free/reduced lunch rate | Title I school (verified) |

## Why Ephesus Matters

### Walkability Leadership
Ephesus is the **#1 most walkable** elementary school in the district—24.7% of students live within 0.5 miles (99 students). Closing it means:
- More buses and transportation costs (~$57K-$75K/year)
- Lost environmental benefits
- Broken neighborhood connections

### Academic Excellence
Despite serving a high-need population, Ephesus achieved **among the top academic growth in the district** - ranking 4th of 11 elementary schools with a growth score of 85.8 ("Exceeded" expectations). This success should be celebrated, not eliminated.

### Exceptional School Climate
The 2024 NC Teacher Working Conditions Survey confirms Ephesus has outstanding school culture:
- **98% of teachers say students follow conduct rules** (29 points above district average)
- **Zero reported incidents** of violence threats, weapons, drugs, or cyberbullying
- **Physical conflicts 5x lower** than district average
- **98% of teachers say Ephesus is a good place to work**

### Equity Imperative
As a Title I school, Ephesus serves our most vulnerable students. It also houses 2 of 3 district EC Pre-K staff members. Closure would disproportionately harm low-income families and children with special needs.

### Strategic Location
The Town of Chapel Hill has invested in housing near Ephesus, with 563 total units in development (149 affordable + 414 market-rate). Closing the school would undermine these community investments.

## The Question for the Board
The 2024 bond allocates $174.7 million to replace three schools built in 1958-1962. Meanwhile, newer schools serving walkable, diverse communities face closure.

**Why spend $174.7M on older buildings while closing newer schools that serve walkable, diverse, high-growth communities?**

## Our Request
1. Remove Ephesus Elementary from closure consideration
2. Recognize Ephesus as a model for neighborhood school success
3. Align school planning with Town housing investments
4. Prioritize equity by protecting Title I schools

## Conclusion
Short-term budget pressures should not override the long-term costs of losing a thriving neighborhood school. Ephesus Elementary delivers exceptional value for students, families, and the entire community.
