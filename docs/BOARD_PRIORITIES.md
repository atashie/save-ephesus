# School Board Stated Priorities and Goals - Collated References

## Summary

This document collates specific references to CHCCS Board of Education priorities, goals, and decision-making frameworks as they relate to elementary schools, drawn from official documentation in the Save Ephesus project.

---

## 1. Core Board Priorities (5 Official Pillars)

**Source:** `docs/BOARD_MEETING_MINUTES.md` (lines 147-152)

The CHCCS Board has stated these five priorities:

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1. Fiscal responsibility | Managing taxpayer resources efficiently |
| 2. Educational excellence | Maintaining high academic standards |
| 3. Community engagement | Involving stakeholders in decisions |
| 4. Equity and access | Ensuring fair opportunities for all students |
| 5. Environmental sustainability | Aligning with climate and environmental goals |

---

## 2. Community Values (From Board Presentations)

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 184-192, Slide 15)

The board presented four key themes from community feedback:

1. **"Buildings need attention"** - Community recognizes district buildings are in dire need of replacement and/or improvements

2. **"Walkability"** - Maintain school walkability and minimize disruption

3. **"Equity"** - Assess impact on racial or ethnic groups

4. **"Community voice"** - Include community input on how the plan can be done

> **Key Quote:** "Maintain school walkability and minimize disruption" is explicitly stated as a community value the board is responding to.

---

## 3. Official 11-Factor Decision Framework

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 36-53, Slide 12)

The district uses 11 interconnected drivers for all facility decisions:

| # | Driver | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | FCI | Facility Condition Index (≥65% = replacement candidate) |
| 2 | School age | Age of the facility |
| 3 | Educational suitability | How well building supports modern education |
| 4 | Classroom size | Adequacy of classroom dimensions |
| 5 | School utilization | Enrollment vs. capacity |
| 6 | Educational programs | Program requirements (DL, STEM, etc.) |
| 7 | Physical site (land) | Available land for expansion/replacement |
| 8 | Finances | Budget and funding availability |
| 9 | Operational efficiencies | Utility costs, maintenance efficiency |
| 10 | District goals | Strategic priorities |
| 11 | Most kids in new schools | Maximize students benefiting from new facilities |

---

## 4. Walkability as Explicit Evaluation Criterion

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 87-97, Slide 36)

The board explicitly evaluates **walkability impact** using a 3-tier framework:

| Metric | Good (Green) | Medium (Yellow) | Bad (Red) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Walkability to school impact** | **Maintained** | **Reduced** | **Not available** |
| Impact on bus routes | ≤5 routes added | 6-15 routes added | ≥16 routes added |
| Student ride time | ≤5 minutes | 6-10 minutes | ≥11 minutes |
| Corridor traffic impact | Minimal | Moderate | Many vehicles added |
| Public transportation access | At school site | Near school site | None in area |

> **Implication:** Closing a walkable school would shift walkability status from "Maintained" (Green) to "Not available" (Red).

---

## 5. Equity Assessment Requirement

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 75-84, Slide 34)

The board requires formal equity assessment in all facility decisions:

| Priority | Evaluation Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| Woolpert plan alignment | Yes / Not applicable / Not in alignment |
| SAPFO compliance | Yes / Not applicable / No |
| Dual Language consolidation | Yes / Not applicable / No |
| **Student displacement impact** | <200 (Green) / 200-450 (Yellow) / 500+ (Red) |
| Educational adequacy | Yes / Not applicable / No |

> **Quote from document:** "The framework requires assessing 'impact on racial or ethnic groups' - relevant given Ephesus's Title I status and demographic composition." (line 226)

---

## 6. Historical Equity Acknowledgment

**Source:** `data/processed/safe_routes_analysis.md` (lines 287-320)

The Safe Routes to School Action Plan (adopted by Town Council 6/11/2025) includes explicit equity acknowledgment that the school district has endorsed:

> **Direct Quote:** "It is important that this SRTS Action Plan acknowledges this history so that the strategies included serve all students and families in the district, **especially those who have disproportionately shouldered the burdens of transportation 'progress' in the past.**" (line 314)

Key historical context cited:
- Pre-1960s segregation forced Black students to walk up to 5 miles on unpaved roads
- Black neighborhoods didn't have paved roads until 1950
- "The district did not provide transportation for transfers, so the option [to transfer to better schools] was not available to children who lived beyond walking distance"

---

## 7. Orange County BOCC Framework (Funding Principles)

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 60-66, Slide 7)

School capital projects are funded based on consistency with these principles:

1. Replace old facilities with new facilities
2. Improve educational adequacy of the buildings
3. Address high priority capital maintenance needs throughout each district

---

## 8. Alignment with Town/Regional Plans

**Source:** `data/processed/bond_presentation_2024.md` (lines 195-210, Slides 30-33)

The board explicitly commits to alignment with local transportation and community plans:

- 2022-2042 Carrboro Connects Comprehensive Plan
- 2050 Metropolitan Transportation Plan
- Community Climate Action Plan (CCAP) 2020
- Comprehensive Bicycle Transportation Plan Update 2020
- Chapel Hill Transit Short Range Plan 2020
- 2020 Chapel Hill Mobility and Connectivity Plan

> **Implication:** Decisions that contradict walkability goals would conflict with these aligned plans.

## 9. Board Chair Statement on Closures

**Source:** `docs/BOARD_MEETING_MINUTES.md` (lines 79-80) *

> **George Griffin, Board Chair (August 2024):**
> "My fear tonight is someone is going to get a piece of this presentation and immediately start to say there's another agenda or we're trying to close a school. **We're simply not.**"

> **Note:** This quote appears in the project's research summary document but lacks a direct primary source citation. The original source (board meeting video, news article, or Substack) should be verified before using in official advocacy materials.

---

## 10. February 2025 Decision: No Closures

**Source:** `docs/BOARD_MEETING_MINUTES.md` (lines 83-87)

The Board ultimately decided NOT to close any schools, opting instead to:

1. Replace the 3 oldest buildings (Carrboro, Estes Hills, FPG)
2. **Preserve neighborhood school model**
3. Monitor enrollment trends

---

## 11. What Worked in Advocacy (Board Response)

**Source:** `docs/BOARD_MEETING_MINUTES.md` (lines 140-145)

The board minutes document these factors as influential in the 2025 decision:

1. **Community engagement** - Parents attended board meetings
2. **Walkability arguments** - Emphasized neighborhood school value
3. **Equity focus** - Title I school serving diverse population
4. **Housing development** - Alignment with Town investments
