**Source:** `07.18.24_2024 Bond Project Update Presentation.pptx`
**Presentation Date:** July 18, 2024
**Collaboration:** Orange County + Woolpert Facility Master Plan

---

## 1. Overview

This presentation outlines the approach to school facility decisions under the 2024 bond referendum. It establishes the decision-making framework, evaluation criteria, and bond options being considered for CHCCS facilities.

Key stakeholders:
- CHCCS (Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools)
- Orange County BOCC (Board of County Commissioners)
- Woolpert (Facility Master Plan consultants)

---

## 2. Ephesus Elementary Status

**Ephesus is NOT included in the current bond options.**

Ephesus is designated for **Phase 2** (next bond referendum), listed alongside:
- Seawell Elementary
- Glenwood Elementary

References to Ephesus in the presentation:
- **Slide 20 (Option 2A):** "Replacement of Phillips MS allows for quicker replacement of elementary schools in next bond referendum (i.e., Estes Hills, Seawell, Ephesus, and Glenwood)"
- **Slide 28 (Option 5):** "Replacement of Estes Hills ES allows for potential replacement of elementary schools (Phase 2) in next bond referendum (i.e., Seawell, Ephesus, and Glenwood)"

**Implication:** Current bond decisions will affect which schools are prioritized for Phase 2, including Ephesus.

## 3. Decision-Making Framework (11 Drivers)

The district uses 11 interconnected drivers for facility decisions (Slide 12):

| # | Driver | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | FCI | Facility Condition Index (≥65% = replacement candidate) |
| 2 | School age | Age of the facility |
| 3 | Educational suitability | How well building supports modern education |
| 4 | Classroom size | Adequacy of classroom dimensions |
| 5 | School utilization | Enrollment vs. capacity |
| 6 | Educational programs | Program requirements (DL, STEM, etc.) |
| 7 | Physical site (land) | Available land for expansion/replacement |
| 8 | Finances | Budget and funding availability |
| 9 | Operational efficiencies | Utility costs, maintenance efficiency |
| 10 | District goals | Strategic priorities |
| 11 | Most kids in new schools | Maximize students benefiting from new facilities |

## 4. County Requirements & District Priorities

### Orange County BOCC Framework (Slide 7)

School capital projects funded based on consistency with Woolpert Plan principles:
1. Replace old facilities with new facilities
2. Improve educational adequacy of the buildings
3. Address high priority capital maintenance needs throughout each district

### Facility Condition Index (FCI) - Slide 10

- General indicator of facility health
- Metric to compare dissimilar facilities
- Higher FCI = greater need
- **FCI ≥65% = candidates for replacement**
- FCI is only one indicator; building age, educational adequacy, and site layout also contribute

### District Priorities (Slide 34)

| Priority | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| Woolpert plan alignment | Yes / Not applicable / Not in alignment |
| SAPFO compliance | Yes / Not applicable / No |
| Dual Language consolidation | Yes / Not applicable / No |
| Student displacement impact | <200 (Green) / 200-450 (Yellow) / 500+ (Red) |
| Educational adequacy | Yes / Not applicable / No |

---

## 5. Transportation Impact Criteria (Slide 36)

| Metric | Good (Green) | Medium (Yellow) | Bad (Red) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Impact on bus routes | ≤5 routes added | 6-15 routes added | ≥16 routes added |
| Student ride time | ≤5 minutes | 6-10 minutes | ≥11 minutes |
| Corridor traffic impact | Minimal vehicles added | Moderate vehicles added | Many vehicles added |
| Public transportation access | At school site | Near school site | None in area |
| Walkability to school impact | Maintained | Reduced | Not available |

**Key takeaway for Ephesus advocacy:** Walkability and transportation impact are explicit evaluation criteria. Closing a walkable school like Ephesus would negatively impact these metrics.

---

## 6. Facilities Optimization Criteria (Slides 38-39)

| Criterion | Evaluated Aspect |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Operational efficiencies | Utility costs and maintenance |
| Reduction of portfolio age | Lowering average age of district facilities |
| Improvement of FCI | Bettering overall facility condition |
| Maintains future MS school site | Preserving land for future middle school |
| Maximize students in new schools | Most kids benefiting from new construction |
| Planning for 10-year needs | Long-term enrollment projections |
| School capacity and enrollment distribution | Balanced utilization across schools |
| Phasing challenges | Ease of construction sequencing |

## 7. Bond Options Summary

### Option 2 (Spanish Dual Language Consolidation)

**Key actions:**
- Build new building/addition on land adjacent to Morris Grove ES for Dual Language campus
- Reassign Morris Grove ES students (~400 displaced) to adjacent schools
- Relocate ES Spanish Dual Language and Newcomer programs to Morris Grove campus
- Replace Carrboro ES onsite (using FPG as swing school)
- Replace Culbreth MS onsite
- Take FPG ES offline; reassign students

**Advantages:**
- All Spanish DL students (~850) at one campus
- Reduces average district school age by 6 years
- Improves FCI from Poor to Good
- Minimizes additional bus routes

**Disadvantages:**
- ~400 Morris Grove students displaced
- Bus ride time may increase for displaced students
- Counter to Town of Carrboro walkability goals
- No guarantee Estes Hills ES will be built in future

### Option 2A (Variant)

- Same as Option 2, plus Phillips MS replacement
- Allows quicker replacement of Estes Hills, **Seawell, Ephesus, and Glenwood** in next bond

### Option 3/3A (No Dual Language Consolidation)

**Key actions:**
- Build replacement FPG/Dual Language ES on land adjacent to Morris Grove ES
- Replace Carrboro ES onsite
- Reassign Morris Grove ES students (~350 displaced)

**Advantages:**
- Maintains existing DL locations
- Fewer displaced students than Option 2

**Disadvantages:**
- DL programs remain split across multiple campuses
- Complexity in program management

### Option 5 (No Dual Language Consolidation, Estes Hills Replacement Onsite)

**Key actions:**
- Replacement FPG/DL ES adjacent to Morris Grove
- Replace Carrboro ES onsite
- Construct new Estes Hills ES onsite (behind existing school)
- High-priority needs projects at Culbreth and Phillips MS

**Advantages:**
- Follows Woolpert recommendations for FPG, Carrboro ES, and Estes Hills ES
- Estes Hills students remain onsite during construction
- Reduces average school age by 12 years
- Improves FCI from Poor to Best
- Maintains Morris Grove walkability
- Minimizes bus routes and transportation demands
- Allows Woolpert-recommended boundary adjustments after new Estes Hills ES
- Enables Phase 2 replacement of **Seawell, Ephesus, and Glenwood**

**Disadvantages:**
- Athletic field at Phillips unavailable during construction
- More complex phasing than Option 3/3A

## 10. Relevance to Save Ephesus Advocacy

### Key Takeaways

1. **Ephesus is Phase 2:** Not being addressed in current bond, but current decisions affect Phase 2 prioritization

2. **Walkability is an explicit criterion:** The district evaluates options based on walkability impact (Maintained / Reduced / Not available). Closing Ephesus would move from "Maintained" to "Not available" for current walkers.

3. **Transportation costs matter:** Bus routes, ride times, and traffic impact are evaluation criteria. Closing a walkable school increases these metrics.

4. **Community values walkability:** Slide 15 explicitly states community input includes "maintain school walkability and minimize disruption."

5. **Equity assessment required:** The framework requires assessing "impact on racial or ethnic groups" - relevant given Ephesus's Title I status and demographic composition.

6. **Student displacement thresholds:** <200 students = Green, 200-450 = Yellow, 500+ = Red. Ephesus enrollment (~390-410 students per NCES) falls in the Yellow range.

### Advocacy Arguments Supported by This Document

| Argument | Supporting Evidence |
|----------|---------------------|
| Walkability matters | Explicit evaluation criterion (Slide 36); Community value (Slide 15) |
| Transportation impact | 5-tier evaluation framework for bus routes, ride time, traffic |
| Equity concerns | Framework requires racial/ethnic impact assessment |
| Not urgent | Ephesus in Phase 2, not immediate priority |
| Community input | Community values explicitly include walkability and minimal disruption |
