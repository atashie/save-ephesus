## Equity Implications

Closing Ephesus Elementary would disproportionately impact:

1. **Working-class families** who chose this neighborhood for its affordability
2. **First-time homebuyers** who specifically sought affordable school zones
3. **Diverse families** attracted by the combination of good schools and accessible housing

The data shows Ephesus serves the district's most affordable housing market while maintaining academic excellence (#4 in growth). This combination of affordability + quality is rare and should be preserved.
