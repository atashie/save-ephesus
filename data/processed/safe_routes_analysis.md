# Safe Routes To School Action Plan - Comprehensive Analysis

**Source Document:** Chapel Hill Safe Routes to School Action Plan (142 pages)
**Adopted:** Town Council on 6/11/2025
**Publisher:** Town of Chapel Hill
**Consultant:** Toole Design Group
**Grant Funding:** NCDOT SRTS Non-Infrastructure Grant (2023)

---

## Executive Summary

The Town of Chapel Hill has promoted Safe Routes to School (SRTS) for **20 years**. In 2023, Chapel Hill was awarded a SRTS Non-Infrastructure Grant by NCDOT, which funded:
- The Town's first full-time SRTS Coordinator (Alyson West)
- The Town's first comprehensive SRTS Action Plan

This Plan is an appendix to the **Triangle West Vision Zero Action Plan** and contains recommendations for programs, policies, and infrastructure improvements around all 14 schools in Chapel Hill.

### Key Principles (Vision Zero/Safe Systems Approach)
- Deaths and serious injuries are unacceptable
- Humans are vulnerable
- Safety is proactive
- Humans make mistakes
- Responsibility is shared
- Redundancy is crucial

### Benefits of SRTS
1. **Increased safety** for students walking and biking
2. **Improved physical and mental health** - daily physical activity improves academic performance
3. **Improved quality of life** - over 1,100 Chapel Hill households have no vehicle (2023 Census)
4. **Youth independence and self-reliance** - ties walking/biking to freedom of mobility
5. **Community benefits** - reduces greenhouse gas emissions, decreases traffic congestion, reduces transportation costs

## District-Wide School Comparison

### Student Walkability Ranking (Elementary Schools)

The following table ranks elementary schools by **percentage of enrollment within 0.5 miles** — the key metric for walkability. Schools with higher percentages have more students living within easy walking distance relative to their size.

| Rank | School | Within 0.5 mi | Enrollment | % within 0.5 mi | Walk/Bike % |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Ephesus** | **99** | 401 | **24.7%** | 20% |
| 2 | Scroggs | 94 | 406 | 23.2% | 32% |
| 3 | Northside | 64 | 399 | 16.0% | 14% |
| 4 | Rashkis | 65 | 437 | 14.9% | 13% |
| 5 | Estes Hills | 33 | 355 | 9.3% | 19% |
| 6 | FPG | 35 | 528 | 6.6% | 7% |
| 7 | Glenwood | 6 | 408 | 1.5% | 11% |
| 8 | Seawell | **0** | 456 | 0% | 11% |

*Source: Town of Chapel Hill GIS analysis (February 2025), CHCCS enrollment data (2024-2025)*

> **KEY FINDING:** Ephesus is the **#1 most walkable elementary school** — nearly 25% of students live within 0.5 miles. This is the highest percentage in the district, ahead of Scroggs (23.2%), Northside (16.0%), and all other schools.

### Walking/Biking Tally Counts (Fall 2024)

Raw counts of students observed walking and biking during arrival/dismissal:

| School | Walking | Biking | Total Active | % of Enrollment |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Scroggs** | 115 | 16 | **131** | **32%** |
| Chapel Hill High | 127 | 46 | 173 | High school |
| Smith Middle | 98 | 21 | 119 | Middle school |
| Culbreth Middle | 98 | 6 | 104 | 16% |
| East Chapel Hill High | 92 | 20 | 112 | High school |
| **Ephesus** | **64** | **14** | **78** | **20%** |
| Estes Hills | 58 | 11 | 69 | 19% |
| Northside | 51 | 5 | 56 | 14% |
| Rashkis | 38 | 19 | 57 | 13% |
| Glenwood | 38 | 7 | 45 | 11% |
| Phillips Middle | 34 | 6 | 40 | 7% |
| FPG | 30 | 11 | 41 | 7% (magnet) |
| Seawell | 25 | 23 | 48 | 11% |
| Phoenix Academy | 11 | 0 | 11 | Alternative |

> **KEY FINDING:** Ephesus has the **third-highest walking count** (64 students) among elementary schools and the **second-highest active transportation rate** (20%) after Scroggs (32%). This demonstrates strong existing walking culture that would be lost with closure.

### Why Magnet Schools Have Lower Walking Rates

FPG and Glenwood are magnet schools that draw students from across the district. This explains their lower walking percentages despite FPG being the largest elementary school. Neighborhood schools like Ephesus and Scroggs naturally have higher walkability because students live nearby.

### Walking/Biking Observations (November 12, 2024)

Travel tallies during arrival:
- **64 students (16%)** walked to school
- **14 students (4%)** biked to school
- **Total: 78 students (20%)** using active transportation

### Field Observations

During the November 12, 2024 observation:
- Substantial traffic from Ephesus Park (pickleball courts) complicated circulation
- Speeding on Ephesus Church Road observed
- A **near miss between a bicycle and vehicle** was documented
- Pedestrians crossed Ephesus Church Road without designated crosswalks
- Caregivers parked on Churchill Drive to walk students to school

---

## Infrastructure Assessment

### Current Barriers
- Missing sidewalks and marked crosswalks
- Incomplete or faded pavement markings reduce visibility and safety
- Lack of bike lane conflict markings at intersections (motorists lose sight of bike lane)
- Unsafe driver behaviors and high-speed traffic create uncomfortable conditions
- Speeding on Ephesus Church Road (near miss observed between bicycle and vehicle)
- Pedestrians crossing Ephesus Church Road without designated crosswalks
- Caregivers parking on Churchill Drive to walk students to school
- Traffic from Ephesus Park (pickleball courts) complicates circulation

### Current Opportunities
- Bike lanes already exist on Ephesus Church Road
- High-visibility crosswalks and curb ramps can improve intersection safety
- Sidewalk repairs and extensions can close key gaps
- Raised pedestrian crossings on campus can be striped for visibility
- Parking stops can prevent drivers from blocking sidewalks

## Historical Context: School Desegregation and Walkability

The Safe Routes To School Action Plan includes important historical context about how Chapel Hill's school system developed in relation to walkability and equity.

### Key Historical Facts

1. **Pre-1960s Segregation:** After the Civil War, lack of transportation options led to establishment of several community-funded African American neighborhood schools to which students would walk. Former students reported walking **up to five miles each way** along unpaved, muddy roadways.

2. **Infrastructure Inequity:** Predominantly Black neighborhoods did not have access to roadway paving until **1950**.

3. **Desegregation Timeline:**
   - 1954: Brown v. Board of Education
   - 1955: NC adopted "Pupil Assignment Act" and "Pearsall Plan" to slow desegregation
   - 1958: Estes Hills Elementary opened as an **all-white school**
   - 1960: Chapel Hill started desegregation (first NC community to voluntarily adopt a plan)
   - 1961: Estes Hills became first school with both Black and white students
   - 1962: Frank Porter Graham Elementary opened as an **all-white school**
   - 1967: Chapel Hill completed desegregation

4. **Transportation Barriers:** "The district did not provide transportation for transfers, so the option [to transfer to better schools] was not available to children who lived beyond walking distance but did not have access to a daily car ride."

5. **Auto-Oriented Development:** Schools opened in the 1960s-1970s were sited in auto-oriented neighborhoods, making them inaccessible to families without reliable vehicle access.

6. **Sidewalk Requirements:** "Sidewalks were not required as recently as the 1980s and not consistently required until the 2000s."

### Implications for Equity

The Plan explicitly acknowledges: "It is important that this SRTS Action Plan acknowledges this history so that the strategies included serve all students and families in the district, **especially those who have disproportionately shouldered the burdens of transportation 'progress' in the past.**"

This applies directly to Ephesus, which:
- Serves a **35.8% socioeconomically disadvantaged** population
- Has **99 students within walking distance** who may lack car access
- Would force additional transportation burden on families if closed

## District-Wide Survey Results (2024 Intent Survey)

**Respondents:** 5,524 families

### Barriers to Walking/Biking (Ranked)

| Barrier | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| **Distance** | **66%** |
| Safety of intersections and crossings | 52% |
| Speed of traffic along route | 47% |
| Sidewalk or pathways | 41% |
| Weather or climate | 31% |
| Time | 30% |
| Child's before or after-school activities | 25% |
| Violence or crime | 20% |
| Crossing guards | 12% |
| Convenience of driving | 12% |
| Adults to walk or bike with | 12% |

### Parent Comfort with Independent Walking/Biking

| Grade Level | Parents Who Would Allow | Count |
|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Elementary (K-2nd) | 40% | 1,712 |
| Middle School | 36% | 1,526 |
| High School | 24% | 1,047 |
| Never | - | 1,599 |

### Key Finding
**Distance is the #1 barrier** (66%). Closing Ephesus would increase distance to school for 99+ students who currently walk, converting them from walkers to bus riders and directly contradicting SRTS goals.

## Implications for Save Ephesus Campaign

### Verified Claims

1. **99 students live within 0.5 miles** - Confirmed by Town of Chapel Hill GIS (February 2025)
2. **20% of students already walk or bike** - 78 students observed during Nov 2024 tally
3. **35.8% socioeconomically disadvantaged** - Confirms Title I status relevance
4. **#1 in walkability** among elementary schools (24.7% of enrollment within 0.5 miles)

### Infrastructure Investment Already Planned

The Town has committed to significant infrastructure improvements around Ephesus Elementary:
- 8 Tier 3 (highest priority) projects
- 4 Tier 2 projects
- $21,310 demonstration project
- **Multiple intersection improvements**
- **New sidewalks**
- **Bike lane enhancements**
- **Raised intersection at Churchill Dr**

### Key Argument Points

1. **Town is actively investing in Ephesus walkability** - Closing the school would waste planned infrastructure improvements that assume the school remains open.

2. **High walker percentage** - 20% active transportation rate demonstrates strong community demand for walking to school.

3. **Highest walkability in the district** - 99 students (24.7% of enrollment) within 0.5 miles, 192 within 1 mile. This is the highest percentage among all elementary schools.

4. **Equity considerations** - 35.8% socioeconomically disadvantaged students would be disproportionately impacted by longer commutes. Over 1,100 Chapel Hill households lack vehicles.

5. **Distance is the #1 barrier** - Survey shows 66% cite distance as the main barrier to walking. Closing Ephesus increases distance for all current walkers.

6. **Vision Zero alignment** - Town has committed to eliminating traffic deaths and injuries by 2031. More buses = more traffic conflicts.

7. **NCDOT coordination underway** - Multiple projects require NCDOT coordination, indicating serious commitment to implementation.

8. **Other schools being relocated, not Ephesus** - The 2024 bond includes plans to relocate Estes Hills and FPG, but NOT Ephesus. This suggests Ephesus's current location is considered sound for walkability.
